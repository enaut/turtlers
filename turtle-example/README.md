# turtle-example

**⚠️ LEGACY PACKAGE - Bevy-based implementation**

This package contains the original Bevy-based turtle implementation.

**For current development, see [turtle-lib-macroquad](../turtle-lib-macroquad/).**  
**See the [main README](../README.md) for the active project.**

## Status

This package is no longer actively developed. The project has moved to a Macroquad + Lyon architecture for:
- Faster compilation times
- Simpler codebase
- Better rendering quality

Examples here are kept for reference only.
